# catmazon
An Amazon clone for Cat products, made as a student project.
Made in PHP, UI with Bootstrap and database in MySQL

Has user accounts, basic ordering and cart system and a search bar. Administrators can add or remove produtcs, 
add or remove images and mark items as unavailable

This was completed in two weeks with minimal knowledge of PHP and without prior knowledge of MVC, Bootstrap, Git and RESTful 

Looking back at this project, a lot of things are badly written and some conventions are clearly violated. 
This project would require a massive overhaul to be upkept easily.
